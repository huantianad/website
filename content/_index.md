Welcome! This site is simply meant to be a hub for my projects, a centralized about me, and a small blog for occasional thoughts and ramblings. Hope you enjoy your time here!

### About Me
Just a stack of cubes who somehow got hold of a computer. Programmer by trade, fluent in C# and Python, with a bit of Java and JS on the side, but my true love is [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/). An avid FOSS user and contributor, NixOS [user](https://github.com/huantianad/nixos-config) and occasional [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/) contributor.

WIP will add more don't worry
