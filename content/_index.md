Welcome! This site is simply meant to be a hub for my projects, a centralized about me, and a small blog for occasional thoughts and ramblings. I don't plan on writing and posting too much on here, but wanted to have a place to dump any thoughts just in case. 

Hope you enjoy your time here!

### About Me
Just a stack of cubes who somehow got hold of a computer. 
- Programmer by trade, avid FOSS user and contributor, tech nerd in general, and mechanical keyboard enthusiast.
- Rhythm game enjoyer and automation game grinder.
- Music listener and player, perhaps creator soon.
- Dabbling in board games and mechanical pencils.
- Glaceon is the best eeveelution.

#### Cracking the Programming Blog
I am fluent in C# and Python, am currently exploring Haskell and Rust, and use some Java, JS, and C++ because I must. However, my true love is [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).

I happen to be a FOSS enthusiast and Linux user, [NixOS](https://github.com/huantianad/nixos-config) is the Linux distro of my choice, and you may find me contributing to [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/) as well. (You can find my NixOS config [here](https://github.com/huantianad/nixos-config.git.) as well.)

Currently working at [7th Beat Games](https://7thbea.t) on [Rhythm Doctor](https://rhythmdr.com)! I also am the creator of multiple 3rd party tools for Rhythm Doctor, including [LevelSync](https://github.com/huantianad/levelsync) and [rd-downloader](https://github.com/huantianad/rd-downloader) (previously written in Python, now written in Nim).

TODO: put some more project links here!

#### Next Generation Music Game
My current game interests happen to land on rhythm games, my favorites are Rhythm Doctor on PC, maimai in arcade, SDVX at home with iidx and pop'n music incoming! I love every rhythm game though, so if you're a fan of an obscure game, I would love to learn more about it!. Playing Project Sekai, Phigros, vivid/stasis on and off, definitely not a full list of games.

You may also see me playing automation games as well as modded Minecraft, assuming I have the time and accidentally got addicted.
