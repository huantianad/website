# Socials

If you would like to contact me, the best places would be on one of the following:

- **Matrix**: `huantian:huantian.dev`
- **Discord**: `huantian`
- **Email**: [Redacted for now]

Note that if I don't recognize your Discord account, I will likely ignore your friend request. Instead, consider messaging me on Matrix with an informative initial message.

I use the following services with varying levels of activity. Feel free to message me on any of them, though I may not respond on the less often used ones. Once again, I might not respond to friend requests from users I don't recognize.
