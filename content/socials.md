# Socials

If you would like to contact me, the best places would be on one of the following:

- **Matrix**: `huantian:huantian.dev`
- **Discord**: `huantian`
- **Email**: (I'll post my email here later if I feel like it.)

Do note that if you simply friend me on Discord I may deny your friend requiest if I don't recognize your name, so starting a chat with a message on Matrix is the better option.

I use the following services with varying levels of activity. Feel free to message me on any of them, though I may not respond on the less often used ones. Once again, I might not respond to friend requests from users I don't recognize.

Listed in no particular order:
- **Mastodon**: [`huantian@fosstodon.org`](https://fosstodon.org/@huantian)
- **Twitter**: [`huantian`](https://twitter.com/huantian_)
