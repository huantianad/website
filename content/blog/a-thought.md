yk there's always something that drives me to look into people on like youtube that stop posting
i also feel something similar when people post their farewells when they're moving on to something else

just something i was thinking about after km posted this https://youtu.be/-rHD0mKgS-c

there's so many people online that perhaps I've talked to just in passing, or just follow from my end and have never interacted with, or maybe that I've talked to a lot
i wish i could get to know all these people and not be socially awkward
maybe it's enough to just say hi, but how will they know that i do care even if it means so little

to the person reading, i think about you sometimes, id love to talk to you about it
